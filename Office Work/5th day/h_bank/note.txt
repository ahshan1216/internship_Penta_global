Why use meta?

This tells the serializer exactly which fields to include when it serializes or deserializes data

What to_representation does ?

In Django REST Framework, to_representation(self, instance) is used to control how your data is returned â€” usually when you're sending a response (like after user registration).

So in this case, it customizes the output of your serializer. Instead of returning all the fields (even write-only fields like password, role, etc.), you're telling it:

"Only return id, username, email, and a success message."
